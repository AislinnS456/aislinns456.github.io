   <li><h3> I was one of the three organizers for this year's Math for All in Austin Conference. This was one of six nationwide conferences and the only one of it's kind in the State of Texas.

 <h2 style="margin-top: 24px;"> A Technical Guide for Applications</h2>

     <li><h3> As part of this conference, my focus was to organize an "Academic Career Fair" to help undergraduates find all of the information "I wish I had before grad school".
     <li><h3> Here is a living document where undergrads students can find information concerning internships, undergraduate conferences, study-abroad, grad school applications all in one place. My hope is that I can continue to crowd source up-to-date information, so feel free to shoot me a message if you have something to add.
